# Terraform Enterprise Resources for Mentees

This repository contains documentation and resources for learning about Terraform Enterprise administration and best practices.

## Purpose

This is my personal repository for sharing knowledge with mentees I work with. I use it to:

- Document common TFE concepts and troubleshooting scenarios
- Share resources that supplement our mentoring sessions
- Create examples that illustrate typical errors and their solutions
- Build a reference library for teaching TFE administration

## What's Included

Materials focus on practical TFE knowledge:
- Core concepts and architecture
- Common error patterns and debugging approaches
- Real-world troubleshooting examples
- Best practices from field experience

## Disclaimer

> **Important:** This is a personal educational resource, not official HashiCorp or IBM documentation. All content is developed independently for my mentoring activities. Examples and configurations should not be used in production without proper review and validation against official documentation.
