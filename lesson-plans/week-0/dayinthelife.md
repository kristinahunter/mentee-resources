# A Day in the Life: Terraform Enterprise Support Engineer

## What I Actually Do

### The Reality (Not the Job Description)
- **Self-directed workdays**: I choose what to focus on based on my energy and motivation
- **Flexible ticket handling**: I tackle complex challenges when I'm feeling sharp or easier tickets when I need a lighter load
- **Team-based problem solving**: No one expects me to know everything; our team is incredibly supportive
- **Continuous learning environment**: Feeling slightly lost is normal and part of the growth process

### My Day-to-Day Work

**When Handling Support Tickets:**
1. **Understanding the Issue**
   - Decode confusion (often related to documentation or errors)
   - Investigate "nothing changed" scenarios (which usually did change)
   - Troubleshoot intermittent issues (frequently network-related)
   - Identify actual product bugs vs. user misunderstandings
   - Answer implementation questions

2. **Resolution Process**
   - Review logs for error patterns
   - Research similar past issues
   - Attempt to reproduce problems
   - Develop and test solutions
   - Sometimes just provide emotional support while customers work through issues

**Beyond Tickets:**
- Creating knowledge base articles (often automating explanations I'm tired of typing)
- Improving internal documentation
- Building automation tools (the most rewarding part of the job)

## The Skills That Matter Most

**Technical Knowledge:**
- Cloud platforms fundamentals (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Terraform and HashiCorp products
- Git and version control
- Basic scripting for automation
- Command-line troubleshooting

**Support Mindset:**
- Comfortable with "not knowing" and continual learning
- Clear communication with both technical and non-technical people
- Breaking complex problems into manageable parts
- Finding information efficiently
- Adapting to different contexts and technologies

## The Unwritten Rules to Success

1. **Embrace not knowing everything**
   The job isn't about having all answers but knowing how to find them

2. **Use your motivation strategically**
   Some days you'll "kill it" with complex issues, other days handle basics

3. **Create tools that help everyone**
   Personal initiative in automation is highly valued

4. **Balance customer help with team improvement**
   The best support engineers make the whole team better

5. **Know when to ask for help**
   The team's strength is in collaboration, not individual heroics

*This isn't just about technical troubleshooting â€“ it's about being the bridge between customers and our products while continuously improving both.*
